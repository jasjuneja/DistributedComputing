Prerequisite:
    1. Apache Spark(2.3.0)
    2. Java 8
    3. Apache-Maven(If you want to build this project other wise I'm sending you the build package)


Sending you the target folder with jar also, but in any case if you want to build this project you will be needing Maven for this.
After Installing Maven type these commands.
    1. mvn clean install
    2. mvn package

Problems:
1.) Similarity between all pairs of document:

        Input :W a-1|b-2|e-5
               X a-3|c-4|d-5
               Y b-6|c-7|d-8
               Z a-9|e-10
        Here "W" is a document and "a-1" represent a is coming one 1 time in it.
        Output: Output is in a form of list representing the pairs.
         [(W.Z,59), (W.X,3), (X.Z,27), (X.Y,68), (W.Y,12)]

        Command to run the spark Job:
        a. Go to the Assignment Folder.
        b. run  spark-submit --class "SimilarPair" target/Assignment-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
        c. output will be written into output/similarOutput

2. K Mean clustering:

        Input : Is in the form of array of numbers eg. [2,17,26....

        Output : Is in the form of {M1=42.666666666666664, M2=74.42105263157895} where M1 represent the cluster.

        Command to run the spark Job:
          a. Go to the Assignment Folder.
          b. run  spark-submit --class "Kmeans" target/Assignment-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar x y
          c. output will be written into output/kmeansOutput

          here "x" represents Number of Cluster and "y" represents Number of Iterations.
          eg spark-submit --class "Kmeans" target/Assignment-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 2 6

3. Maximal Clique in a Graph:

Input : Is in the form of adjacency list. a {b,e}
                                          b {a,c,e,f,g}
Output : Is in the form of array representing the cliques eg. [([c, g, b, f],[])]
            empty set against an array represent a clique

Command to run the spark Job:
          a. Go to the Assignment Folder.
          b. run  spark-submit --class "MaximalCliques" target/Assignment-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
          c. output will be written into output/cliquesOutput
